# FORENSIC FIX (found during independent review, not in the uploaded audit):
# stage 02's DEPLOYMENT_PROFILE=production digest-pinning gate calls
# `msg_error`, which is a HOST-side function (defined in lib/00-preflight.sh)
# that was never in scope here — install-wordpress.sh runs as its own
# process on the VM, inheriting none of the host script's shell functions.
# Confirmed empirically: under `set -e`, the resulting "command not found"
# (exit 127) still aborts the install, so this was never a silent
# fail-open — but the operator got a bare "msg_error: not found" instead of
# the detailed, actionable message the code was written to show them,
# exactly when a production install is failing for a reason they need to
# understand. err() gives every VM-side stage a real fail-closed helper
# instead of leaning on an undefined-command crash to (accidentally) get
# the right exit behavior.

# ── Deferred production blockers ─────────────────────────────────────────────

# left with FEWER tools to diagnose the problem precisely because a problem had
# occurred, and the box looked half-built for a reason that was not obvious.
#
# Refusing to certify a broken production install is right. Aborting mid-build

# ── Pinned image versions ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# BUG FIX: mariadb:11.4-lts does NOT exist on Docker Hub.
# These are STARTING FLOORS, not the version you end up on. `update.sh check`
# compares each against the registry by digest and `update.sh wp|db` moves to
# the newest tag after a CVE scan and health check -- so the job of these
# values is only to be a safe, current-enough baseline at first boot.
#
# Verified against upstream (Aug 2026):
#   - WordPress 7.1 "Mary Lou" (2026-08-19) is the CURRENT branch, and the
#     reason to be on it is support rather than features: WordPress states
#     that "only the most recent version of WordPress is actively supported".
#     7.0.4 will not receive future security fixes, so staying there is a
#     decaying position however well patched it is today. The 7.0.4 fix below
#     was backported into 7.1 RC3, so nothing is lost by moving.
#
#     TAG VERIFIED before this bump, by the operator, with:
#       skopeo inspect --format '{{.Digest}}' docker://docker.io/library/wordpress:7.1-php8.4-apache
#     -> sha256:dd1d6ff323bae668ebbfb0fce91042e1af7ee8d1568d4308f0f07ce3a4fe5140
#     That step is not ceremony. An earlier release in this series shipped
#     6.9.6-php8.4-apache, a tag that had never existed, and every install
#     died fifteen minutes in on "manifest unknown". Verify the TAG, not the
#     version number.
#
#     A three-day-old MAJOR on client sites is a real risk, and the mitigation
#     is already here: update.sh boots the new image as a candidate on
#     127.0.0.1:18080 and validates it before cutting production over, so a
#     plugin incompatibility surfaces before a visitor sees it.
#
#   - WordPress 7.0.4 (2026-08-12) fixed CVE-2026-65640, CVSS 8.8: an
#     authenticated Author+ REMOTE CODE EXECUTION via malicious file upload,
#     on sites where ImageMagick delegates to Ghostscript. ImageMagick
#     identifies a file by its CONTENT, not its extension; WordPress trusted
#     the extension. A file called holiday.png that is really PostScript became
#     code execution.
#
#     Exposure here is conditional -- it needs BOTH Imagick and Ghostscript on
#     the server -- and it needs an account with upload_files, which means
#     Author or above (Contributors cannot upload). Neither condition makes it
#     safe to skip: 7.0.4 shipped SIX DAYS after 7.0.3, WordPress backported
#     the fix to the 4.7 branch, and their own guidance is that only the most
#     recent release is actively supported.
#
#     It is also a reminder about the Author role specifically. This platform
#     spends most of its effort on the administrator, and this CVE turns
#     "permission to upload media" into code execution -- so a client's guest
#     contributors are worth reviewing, not just their admins.
#
#   - The previous release, 7.0.3 (2026-08-06), fixed 12 issues including
#     including CVE-2026-64638 -- a pre-authentication reflected XSS on the
#     LOGIN PAGE, CVSS 8.9, which can lead to PHP code execution via the
#     plugin/theme editor if an administrator is phished into clicking a
#     crafted link. That is precisely the surface this platform is built to
#     protect, so shipping 7.0.2 was not acceptable. (The custom login slug,
#     the wp-admin IP restriction and DISALLOW_FILE_MODS under production all
#     reduce the exposure, but none of them is the fix; the fix is 7.0.3.)
#
#     Context worth knowing: the PREVIOUS chain (CVE-2026-60137 /
#     CVE-2026-63030, fixed in 7.0.2) entered CISA's Known Exploited
#     Vulnerabilities catalog and saw exploitation attempts roughly 90 minutes
#     after disclosure. WordPress core CVEs are now weaponised in hours, which
#     is the argument for `update.sh check` being run often rather than
#     quarterly.
#
#   - The tag below is what the Docker official image publishes as current
#     (it is also what `latest` points at). LESSON LEARNED THE HARD WAY: an
#     earlier version of this file pinned 6.9.6-php8.4-apache, reasoning from
#     the WordPress *release* history. That tag never existed. The docker
#     library builds a specific set of version+variant combinations, and a
#     WordPress release number is NOT automatically a Docker tag. The install
#     died 15 minutes in with `manifest unknown`. Always verify the TAG, not
#     just the version.
#   - php8.4: 8.3 entered SECURITY-ONLY support on 2025-11-23 (full EOL
#     2027-12-31); 8.4 is the recommended production line, supported through
#     2028-12-31. New installs should start on the supported-with-bugfixes
#     line, not the security-only one.
#   - mariadb:11.4 is LTS, supported to May 2029 -- the longest runway of any
#     current release. The bare "11.4" branch tag tracks patch releases
#     (11.4.12 latest); "11.4-lts" is NOT a real tag and must not be used.

# ── PRUN: podman dispatch wrapper ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# BUG FIX (v7-6d): PRUN used to have a rootless branch that rebuilt the whole

# joins every argument on IFS, discarding the argument boundaries "$@" would
# have preserved. That string was then RE-PARSED by the inner `sh -c`, so any
# argument containing shell metacharacters (spaces, quotes, ;, $()) got
# reinterpreted instead of passed through intact — exactly what happens to
# WORDPRESS_CONFIG_EXTRA's 'define("WP_DEBUG",false);define(...);...' value.
# Now that this script is rootful-only, that dispatch — and the vulnerable
# reconstruction it required — is gone. PRUN is kept as a thin wrapper (so
# every "PRUN <cmd>" call site elsewhere in this installer, update.sh,
# wp-hardening.sh, and validate-wordpress.sh needs no changes), but it now
# ALWAYS calls podman directly with "$@", which preserves argument
