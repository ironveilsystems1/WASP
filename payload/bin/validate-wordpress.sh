# validate-wordpress.sh — live validation and self-service diagnostics
# ============================================================================
# Rewritten in v7-14. The previous version reported WHAT failed but never HOW
# to fix it, and most of its checks only confirmed a container was in state
# "running" — which says nothing about whether the site actually works. An
# operator hitting a problem after install had no path from "✗ something"
# to a resolution without reading the 6000-line provisioning script.
#
# This version:
#   • runs LIVE functional tests (real HTTP fetches, a real DB query through
#     WordPress's own credentials, a real gzip integrity check on the newest
#     backup, a real Skopeo digest resolution) rather than status lookups
#   • attaches a concrete remediation command to every single failure and
#     reprints them all in one block at the end, so fixing is copy-paste
#   • separates FAIL (something is broken) from WARN (works, but will bite
#     you later — disk filling, backup aging, verification degraded)
#   • can be scoped to one area while debugging, instead of all-or-nothing
#
# Usage:
#   validate-wordpress.sh                  run everything
#   validate-wordpress.sh --section web    run one section
#   validate-wordpress.sh --list           show section names
#   validate-wordpress.sh --quiet          only output failures/warnings
#   validate-wordpress.sh --quick          skip slow checks (network, backups)
#   validate-wordpress.sh --send-test-mail <addr>   also deliver a real test email
#
# Exit: 0 = all passed, 1 = one or more failures, 2 = warnings only
# ============================================================================

# v7-16: auto-elevate via doas. This tool reads /etc/wp-install/vars.sh (root-
# only, 0600) and pinned.env, and inspects containers and the firewall — all
# need root. Run as the unprivileged admin over SSH (the session where
# copy/paste actually works; the root console via `qm terminal` can't paste)
# it used to fail immediately with "can't open /etc/wp-install/vars.sh:
# Permission denied", and every check that reads a vars.sh value then saw an
# empty string and reported a FALSE result — "Digest pinning: 0/3 pinned"
# while `update.sh` correctly showed 3/3, and "No wp-admin IP restriction
# configured" when ADMIN_CIDR was in fact set. Re-exec through doas so the
# tool "just works" over SSH: doas prompts for the admin password once (permit
# persist :wheel), then everything runs as root with output in the copyable
# SSH session. --help/--list need no privileges, so they skip elevation.
