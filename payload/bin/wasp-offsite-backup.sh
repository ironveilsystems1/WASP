# wasp-offsite-backup.sh — copy database backups off this VM
# =============================================================================
#   wasp-offsite-backup.sh push [file]   send a backup (newest if omitted)
#   wasp-offsite-backup.sh verify        confirm the newest local backup is there
#   wasp-offsite-backup.sh list          what is stored remotely

#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# A backup on the same VM as the thing it protects is not a backup. It shares
# the disk, the hypervisor, and the attacker. The single most common
# ransomware pattern against small hosting is: encrypt the site, then delete
# the backups sitting next to it — and the operator discovers both at once.
#
# THE PART THAT MATTERS MORE THAN THE TRANSPORT
#
# Whatever method is used, this VM holds a credential that can reach the
# backup destination. An attacker with root here can therefore reach it too.
# Copying backups off the VM does not, on its own, protect them from that
# attacker — it protects them from disk failure and from losing the VM.
#
# What closes the gap is making the destination APPEND-ONLY, so the credential
# stored here can add backups but cannot delete or overwrite them:
#
#   SSH/rsync : give the key a forced command in authorized_keys, e.g.
#               command="rrsync -no-del /srv/backups/wasp",restrict ssh-ed25519 ...
#               so the key cannot run arbitrary commands or delete anything.
#   S3        : an IAM policy granting s3:PutObject and s3:ListBucket but NOT
#               s3:DeleteObject, with Versioning and Object Lock enabled on
#               the bucket. Object Lock in compliance mode cannot be removed
#               even by the account root during the retention window.
#
# Without that, an attacker who owns this VM owns the backups as well, and the
# offsite copy is protection against accident rather than against malice. Both
# are worth having; they are not the same thing, and it should be a decision
# rather than an assumption. `status` says which one you have.
#
# CREDENTIALS live under /etc/wp-install, root-owned and 0400/0600. WordPress
# runs as uid 33 and cannot read them, so a compromise of the web application
# alone does not reach the backup destination — only a root compromise does.
# =============================================================================
set -u

# Error capture goes to a per-run file, not a fixed name.
#
# A predictable path under /tmp that a root process writes to is CWE-377: any
# local user (or a compromised container with a shared /tmp) can pre-create it
# as a symlink and have root truncate whatever it points at. The path was
# fixed and dot-prefixed, which hides it from `ls` and from nobody else.

# ── One source of truth: offsite.conf ────────────────────────────────────────
# vars.sh ALSO carries OFFSITE_DEST, written at install as the provisioning
# record. This tool reads offsite.conf and nothing else.
#
# That split cost a real operator an hour. They edited OFFSITE_DEST in vars.sh
# to change bucket, confirmed the edit with grep, confirmed the value sourced
# correctly with `. vars.sh; echo $OFFSITE_DEST` -- and `status` kept reporting
# the old destination, because the tool never reads that file. Nothing was
# wrong with what they did; two files held the same setting and neither said
# which one wins.
#
# offsite.conf is authoritative because it is what runs. vars.sh remains the
# install-time record. To avoid the same hour happening twice, a mismatch is
# now DETECTED and reported rather than silently ignored -- and
# `set-destination` exists so nobody has to hand-edit either file.

# ── Encryption before it leaves the VM ───────────────────────────────────────
# A database dump is not an opaque blob. It contains password hashes, every
# user's email and real name, private and draft post content, and whatever
# plugins have written into wp_options -- API keys, form submissions, order
# records. Handing that to a storage provider in plaintext gives them, and
# anyone who reaches the bucket, all of it.
#
# age is used in PUBLIC-KEY mode, and that choice is the point rather than a
# detail: this VM holds only the RECIPIENT (public) key. It can encrypt
# backups and cannot decrypt them -- not the ones it sends, and not the ones
# already at the destination. So an attacker with root here cannot read the
# backups even though they can create them.
#
# That composes with an append-only destination: they cannot delete what is
# there and cannot read it either.
#
# THE COST, and it is real: if the private key is lost, every encrypted backup
# is permanently unrecoverable. An encrypted backup nobody can decrypt is not
# a backup. The private key belongs somewhere that is neither this VM nor the
# storage bucket.
#
# The LOCAL backup is deliberately left unencrypted. It never leaves the host,
# it is already behind the VM boundary, and keeping it readable is what allows
# wasp-selftest.sh to prove a restore actually works. Encrypting the copy that
# leaves your control while keeping the one that does not is the split that
# preserves both properties.

# ── Parse offsite.conf. DO NOT SOURCE IT. ────────────────────────────────────
# This file used to be read with `. "$CONF"`, which EXECUTES it. Every line ran
# as root, on every backup, every night. Anything able to write that file -- a
# path traversal, a careless chmod, a compromised process wanting persistence
# -- got root code execution on the next cron tick, from a file nobody thinks
# of as executable.
#
# Raised by an external evaluation. The fix is the one the Linux kernel made
# for the same problem: "Don't source the kernel config file in shell scripts.
# The config file is not a shell script." Read it line by line instead.
#
# The usual middle ground -- grep for NAME=VALUE lines then source the filtered
# copy -- is deliberately NOT used. The Bash Hackers Wiki says of it, accurately,
# that it "doesn't prevent all methods of code execution". A parser that CANNOT
# execute anything is no harder to write than a filter that mostly cannot.
#
# Explicit key allowlist, values assigned by case rather than eval. There is no
# path from file contents to execution.

    # database -- and restoring that into the throwaway container overwrites
    # its own credential tables with the SOURCE system's. Partway through the

    # server whose credentials the restore had just replaced.

    # This cost three attempts, each blamed on how the password was passed --
    # MYSQL_PWD, then a defaults file -- when the credential was correct every
    # time and the restore was invalidating it mid-stream.
    #
    # The system schemas are not what a drill is proving. Skip them and restore
    # the site's data, which is the thing that has to come back.
    # USE THE FORM THAT DEMONSTRABLY WORKS.

    # wasp-selftest.sh restores the identical dump into an identical throwaway
    # container with `-p"$pw"` inline, and it PASSES -- the same run that fails
    # here reports "[PASS] Archive restored without error". Two theories were
    # tried instead and both were wrong: MYSQL_PWD, then a defaults file, and
    # then filtering the mysql schema on the assumption the restore was
    # invalidating its own credentials. The local path does none of that and
    # succeeds, which disproves all three.
    #
    # So this now matches the working code rather than improving on it. The
    # password is random, the container is unreachable from the host network,
    # and it is destroyed seconds later -- argv exposure inside it is a smaller
    # risk than a restore drill that has never once completed.
