# update.sh — WordPress VM update utility
# Usage: update.sh [check|status|os|wp [VER]|db [VER]|crowdsec [VER]|digest-check|all|trivy]
#
# INTEGRATION NOTES (read before dropping this in):
#  - Rootful only. No ROOTLESS_MODE, no PRUN dispatch wrapper — every call is
#    a plain `podman ...`. If your install script still writes ROOTLESS_MODE
#    into /etc/wp-install/vars.sh that's harmless; it's just never read here.
#  - Assumes container names wordpress / mariadb / crowdsec, and the
#    network-segmented layout from the v7-6/v7-6c line: wp-front (public,
#    WordPress's egress + published port) and wp-db (--internal,
#    WordPress+MariaDB only). MariaDB is addressed purely by DNS name
#    ("mariadb", via aardvark-dns + an explicit --network-alias on wp-db)
#    rather than a fixed IP baked into WordPress — v7-11 removed the old
#    --add-host "mariadb:10.89.20.2" entries that used to shadow this (see
#    that patch note for why a static entry was actively wrong, not just
#    redundant, and why removing it doesn't touch wp-db's own isolation).
#    If your main script still uses a single flat wp-net, wp-front/wp-db
#    is the only naming assumption left to adjust to match.
#  - Reads /etc/wp-install/vars.sh for USE_DIGEST_PINNING and GEOIP_ENABLED
#    (same file your installer already writes) and reads/writes a new
#    /etc/wp-install/pinned.env for per-component pinned tag+digest — see
#    the PINNED STATE note below. Pair this file with the companion
#    installer-side snippet (digest-pinning + Skopeo block) so pinned.env
#    exists from first boot; if it doesn't exist yet, this script bootstraps
#    it from whatever's currently running the first time it's invoked.
#  - Container-recreation commands (the actual `podman run ...` blocks in
#    do_wp_update/do_db_update/do_cs_update) mirror the flags your install
#    script should already be using to create these containers the first
#    time (caps, mounts, env-file, etc.). If your install script customizes
#    any of that, mirror the same customization here or the recreated
#    container will drift from the original.
#  - `update.sh wp` validates a freshly pulled WordPress image on a
#    throwaway "wordpress-candidate" container bound to 127.0.0.1:18080
#    (WP_CANDIDATE_PORT, defined below) — using the same wp-health-check.sh
#    depth as every other health-check site in this script — before it
#    ever touches the production container on :80. Production is only
#    renamed and stopped once that candidate passes. Needs 127.0.0.1:18080
#    free on the VM; change WP_CANDIDATE_PORT if that's already in use for
#    something else.
#
# WHAT CHANGED FROM THE PRE-SKOPEO VERSION OF THIS SCRIPT:
#  - `digest-check` (and therefore a bare `update.sh`/`update.sh check`)
#    used to `podman pull` WordPress, MariaDB, AND CrowdSec on every single
#    invocation just to see whether the registry had republished anything
#    under the same tag — 500 MB-1 GB+ downloaded to answer "did anything
#    change?", every time, even when the answer was no. Skopeo's
#    `inspect docker://ref` asks the registry's manifest endpoint directly
#    (a few KB, no layer data) and reports the digest currently published
#    for a tag without pulling anything. Every digest check below tries
#    Skopeo first; a `podman pull` only happens once a digest is actually
#    going to be used — because it's new, or because Skopeo itself failed,
#    in which case this falls back to pulling by tag and asking Podman what
#    it resolved (the old method — still correct, just back to the old
#    bandwidth cost for that one check).
#  - The old version derived "what tag/digest is currently pinned" by
#    sed-parsing it back out of the running container's own
#    `{{.Config.Image}}` string, which only worked because a pinned
#    reference still had a visible tag in it (`repo:tag@sha256:digest`) —
#    itself dependent on a runtime test of whether this Podman accepted a
#    combined tag+digest reference at all. Every pull below is now a plain
#    `repo@sha256:digest` (no tag, no ambiguity, no version-dependent
#    combined-reference test needed), and the tag is tracked explicitly in
#    /etc/wp-install/pinned.env instead of being re-derived from a string
#    that may no longer contain it.
#  - A bare `update.sh` / `update.sh check` / `update.sh status` is now
#    READ-ONLY: it reports what's running, what's pinned, and whether the
#    registry has anything newer (Skopeo only — no pulls, no prompts).
#    `update.sh all` is the explicit "update everything" command (unchanged
#    otherwise — each component still asks before touching anything).
#    `update.sh digest-check` still exists as a shortcut for "refresh
#    wp/db/crowdsec if the registry has anything newer, skip the OS package
#    prompt" — it now shares the same Skopeo-first check the wp/db/crowdsec
#    update paths use directly, instead of a separate implementation that
#    used to re-pull everything just to compare.

# ── Container-state preflight — stop suppressing critical Podman errors ────
# PRODUCTION SAFETY FIX (v7-6k): every "swap in a replacement container"
# path in this script hid its `podman rename <live> <live>-old` behind
# `2>/dev/null || true` (WordPress's forward swap), and every rollback swap
# (`podman rename <live>-old <live>` for WordPress, MariaDB, AND CrowdSec)
# discarded its result the same way. That meant a rename failure — source
# container missing, a stale *-old container left over from a previous
# crashed/interrupted update, or Podman itself in an inconsistent state —
# was silently swallowed and the script carried on as if nothing had
# happened.
#
# The concrete failure this caused in do_wp_update(): if
# `podman rename wordpress wordpress-old` silently failed, "wordpress" kept
# its original name, so the following `podman run -d --name wordpress ...`
# then failed too (a name collision) — a failure that WAS checked, so
# control fell into the "container start failed — rolled back" branch.
# That branch's first line was `podman rm -f wordpress`, deleting the
# still-good, still-running ORIGINAL WordPress container in the mistaken
# belief it was cleaning up a failed new attempt. One suppressed error
# cascaded into deleting a healthy production container.
#
# require_clean_container_state() closes the forward half of this by
# verifying the rename's own preconditions up front instead of discovering
# them via a cascading failure two steps later. Every rename call site below
# — forward swap and rollback swap, across WordPress, MariaDB, and CrowdSec
# — now also checks the rename/start result directly instead of discarding
# it, and prints exactly what needs manual attention when a rollback itself
# fails, since that's the one moment silence is most dangerous: it means the
# site (or the database, or CrowdSec) is down right now and nobody has been

# ── Skopeo: remote digest lookup, no image pull ────────────────────────────
# $1 = full tag reference, e.g. docker.io/wordpress:7.1-php8.4-apache
# stdout: sha256:<64 hex> on success. Returns 1 on any failure (Skopeo
# missing, network error, unparseable output) — every caller treats that as
# "fall back to the old method", never as fatal.
#
# BUG FIX (v7-14) — THIS RETURNED A MULTI-LINE VALUE AND SILENTLY BROKE
# DIGEST PINNING AND digest-check. `skopeo inspect` emits a top-level
# "Digest" (the image manifest digest — the one we want) AND a "LayersData"
# array in which EVERY ENTRY also has its own "Digest" field. The old
# extraction was:
#     grep -oE '"Digest"...' | grep -oE 'sha256:[0-9a-f]{64}'
# with no head/limit, so for a typical WordPress image it returned the
# manifest digest followed by 10-20 layer digests, one per line. Two
# concrete failures resulted, both silent:
#   1. _pin_digest() built candidate="${repo}@${digest}" from that
#      multi-line value, producing a syntactically invalid image reference.
#      `podman pull` rejected it every time, burned all 3 retry attempts
#      with 4-second sleeps, logged a scary "Skopeo resolved a digest but
#      pulling it failed" warning, then fell through to the tag-pull
#      fallback — meaning the entire "resolve cheaply via Skopeo without
#      pulling" design never actually took effect, and every install did
#      full pulls anyway.
#   2. Worse: show_check_summary()'s _report_one() and do_digest_check()
#      compare the resolved remote digest against the stored single-line
#      digest from pinned.env. A multi-line value can never equal a
#      single-line one, so EVERY `update.sh check` reported "NEWER DIGEST
#      AVAILABLE under this tag" for all three components on every run,
#      forever, and `update.sh digest-check` re-pulled and re-deployed all
#      three components every single time it ran even when nothing had
#      changed upstream.
# FIX: ask Skopeo for exactly the one field via its Go-template --format
# (unambiguous, no parsing), fall back to the grep path with an explicit
# `head -1` for older Skopeo builds that lack --format, and validate the
# final value is exactly one well-formed sha256 line before returning it.
# Set by _skopeo_digest so callers can distinguish "the registry says this
# tag does not exist" (fatal — no point pulling or scanning) from "the lookup
# failed" (transient — falling back to a tag comparison is reasonable).

# ── Vulnerability exception governance ───────────────────────────────────────
# Replaces a bare y/N. A yes/no leaves no record of WHO accepted WHAT, WHY, or
# WHEN it should be revisited -- so an accepted CVE silently becomes permanent
# and nobody can later reconstruct the decision.
#
# The design goes slightly beyond "type a reason and email it", at no extra
# cost to the operator, because a reason alone still has two gaps:
#
#   SCOPE   The exception records the exact IMAGE DIGEST and is only honoured
#           for that digest. Accepting a finding on one image must not silently
#           carry over to the next image, which will have a different set of
#           vulnerabilities. A blanket "yes" that outlives its subject is how
#           exceptions become policy by accident.
#   EXPIRY  Exceptions expire (default 90 days) and then have to be re-argued.
#           Without this, the first person to type a reason decides forever.
#
# The record is append-only and root-owned; the email is a copy, not the
# record, because mail can fail and an audit trail that depends on delivery is
# not an audit trail.

  # ── CANDIDATE: prove the pulled image works BEFORE production is touched
  # (item 40 — merged in from a third parallel line off v7-6f). See the
  # WORDPRESS UPDATE CUTOVER header note for the full history: starting the
  # new "wordpress" straight on -p 80:80 while the old one was merely
  # renamed (still running, still holding port 80) was a structural
  # guarantee of failure, not an occasional race. The pulled image is
  # proven out here instead, on a throwaway container bound ONLY to
  # loopback:WP_CANDIDATE_PORT, with production left completely alone.
  #
  # BUG FIX (v7-13, ChatGPT Finding 3 in the audit): the candidate used to
  # bind-mount PRODUCTION's /home/wpuser/wp/html rw, /home/wpuser/wp/logs
  # rw, and /home/wpuser/wp/htaccess/.htaccess rw — so a plugin
  # write-on-init code path in the candidate image (cache seeding,
  # transient files under wp-content/uploads, a first-request
  # optimization that touches a marker file) could pollute the live
  # production docroot BEFORE the candidate had even been declared
  # healthy. Candidate failure then left production storage with
  # candidate-authored artifacts that outlived the throwaway container.
  # Mitigated here by three changes to the mount surface, none of which
  # break the health check itself (HTTP GET / + PHP exec + DB DNS + real
  # DB query — none require write access to any of these paths):
  #   • /home/wpuser/wp/html mounted :ro (read-only). The candidate can
  #     serve every file production serves, but cannot write to any of
  #     them. If the new image's WordPress ships a plugin that writes on
  #     init, the write itself will EACCES — which is the CORRECT signal:
  #     that plugin behavior would corrupt production either way, catching
  #     it against a throwaway is far cheaper than catching it live.
  #   • /var/log/apache2 bind-mounted to its own logs-candidate directory,
  #     owned 33:33 like production's (a tmpfs here is root-owned and Apache
  #     runs as www-data, so it could not create error.log at all)
  #     the candidate, and there's nothing to clean up after — the tmpfs
  #     disappears with the container.
  #   • The production .htaccess is mounted :ro rather than :rw. v7-13
  #     dropped this mount entirely, which removed the write path but also
  #     meant the candidate ran with NO .htaccess at all — no 8G firewall,
  #     no slug rules, no WordPress permalink rules — so it was no longer
  #     testing the configuration production actually serves. Read-only
  #     restores that fidelity while keeping the write path closed.
  # WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE=staging is also set as a hint to well-behaved
  # plugins to skip write-on-init side effects; WordPress core itself
  # respects this env var per the WordPress developer docs.
  #
  # RESIDUAL RISK (ChatGPT Finding 4 in the audit — Deliberately NOT fixed
  # here): the candidate still authenticates to the LIVE production
  # database with production credentials. ChatGPT's suggested full fix
  # (spin up a temporary MariaDB, restore the daily dump into it, create
  # temporary WordPress credentials, run the candidate against that copy,
  # tear it all down) would double disk usage during every update, add
  # minutes-per-GB of dump restore time to every image refresh, and
  # introduce a new class of failure modes (temporary-DB startup, dump
  # restore integrity, credential lifecycle) that themselves need careful
  # rollback handling. That trade-off doesn't make sense for THIS
  # script's purpose — the candidate's DB interactions are limited to
  # what a health check needs (getent hosts mariadb, PHP mysqli connect,
  # SELECT 1, plus whatever a GET / for an anonymous user triggers with
  # DISABLE_WP_CRON=true, WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE=staging, and now a RO
  # docroot). WordPress schema migrations are triggered by wp-admin/
  # upgrade.php loaded WHILE authenticated, not by anonymous requests, so
  # a version-mismatched candidate cannot silently migrate the live DB.
  # The remaining exposure — an anonymous plugin init routine that
  # opportunistically writes an options-table row on first request — is
  # bounded, benign, and would happen against production on first real
  # traffic anyway. Documented here rather than half-solved: an operator
  # who needs full DB isolation for their compliance regime can bolt it
  # on with a dump/restore step wrapping this function, but the base
  # script does not pay that cost by default.

  # The lighter half of the isolation problem, and the half worth paying for.

  # a page and boot WordPress, while any write it attempts fails at the
  # database rather than landing in production.

  # read-only candidate cannot run schema upgrades, so this proves "the new
  # image boots and can read this database", not "upgrading this database
  # will succeed". Proving the latter needs a dump restored into a throwaway

  # skip the CrowdSec image update entirely if MariaDB rolled back for any

  # per-component summary at the end, so an operator sees exactly which
  # components succeeded, which rolled back, and which weren't reached.

# digest-check answers "has the tag I'm on been rebuilt?" (same version, new
# digest). This answers a different question: "has a newer VERSION been
# published?" — e.g. you're pinned to WordPress 7.0.4 and 7.0.5 is out with a
# security fix. It lists available tags from the registry (Skopeo list-tags),
# filters to the real release tags for each image, and compares versions so
# you can SEE a newer release and choose to move the pin to it. `upgrade` then
# walks all three components and, for each newer release, runs the ordinary
# update path (candidate test on loopback, digest re-pin, rollback on
# failure, GeoIP layer rebuilt if it was active) — so version bumps get the
# exact same safety as a normal update.

# pattern is unsafe — an unannounced or preview .3 tag would be offered as a

# rebooted mid-update, etc.) is detected via `kill -0` and cleared
# automatically instead of wedging every future update permanently.
#
# Only the state-changing subcommands below (os/wp/db/crowdsec/all/
# digest-check) take the lock — check/status/trivy stay lock-free since
# they're read-only (no container renames, no pinned.env writes) and are
# meant to stay safe to run anytime, including while an update is already
# in progress (see "bare update.sh is read-only" under WHAT CHANGED above).
