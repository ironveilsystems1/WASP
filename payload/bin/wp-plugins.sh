# wp-plugins.sh — WordPress-level update visibility (plugins, themes, core)
# =============================================================================
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Everything else in this project defends the CONTAINER: digest-pinned
# images, Trivy scanning, fail-closed production gates, `update.sh` for the
# image itself. That is all real protection -- and it covers almost none of
# the actual WordPress attack surface.
#
# `trivy image` scans the image's OS packages and PHP libraries. Plugins and
# themes do not live in the image; they live in the mounted wp-content
# volume, installed by the site owner after deployment. Nothing scanned them
# and nothing reported when they went out of date. Updating the WordPress
# container image updates CORE only.
#
# The proportions matter here. Of the 11,334 WordPress vulnerabilities
# disclosed in 2025 (Patchstack, "State of WordPress Security in 2026"),
# roughly 91% were in plugins and 9% in themes -- core accounted for about
# six. So the hardening that was already in place addressed the ~6, while
# the ~11,300 had no coverage at all. Roughly 43% of those need no
# authentication to exploit, and disclosure-to-exploitation is frequently
# measured in hours.
#
# WHY IT REPORTS BY DEFAULT AND UPDATES ONLY ON REQUEST
#
# Blindly auto-updating plugins is not the obvious win it looks like:
#   - Roughly 46% of disclosed vulnerabilities had no patch available at
#     disclosure, so "update everything" cannot close that window anyway.
#   - Plugin auto-update has itself been the compromise vector in real
#     supply-chain incidents, where legitimate plugins from the official
#     directory shipped malicious updates to sites that trusted them.
#   - An unattended plugin update on a live site can break it with nobody
#     watching.
# So the default is visibility: report what is out of date, let a human
# decide. This mirrors what this VM already does for container images --
# the cron job runs `podman auto-update --dry-run`, never an actual
# unattended update.
#
# HOW IT RUNS
#
# wp-cli is not bundled in the official WordPress image, and downloading
# wp-cli.phar at runtime would add exactly the kind of unverified
# supply-chain dependency this project already refuses elsewhere. Instead
# this uses the official `wordpress:cli` image, digest-pinned like every
# other image here, run as a --rm throwaway that shares the running
# WordPress container's network namespace (--network container:wordpress).
# Sharing the namespace rather than re-attaching networks by hand means it
# resolves `mariadb` and reaches api.wordpress.org exactly the way
# WordPress itself does, with no duplicated network wiring to drift.

# ── Verify core and plugin files against WordPress.org checksums ─────────────
# Detects a plugin or core file that has been MODIFIED since it was installed:
# the signature of a backdoor injected through a vulnerable plugin, which is how
# most WordPress compromises actually persist.
#
# WHY THE EXIT CODE IS NOT TRUSTED
#
# wp-cli's own exit status is not a safe pass/fail here, and this is documented
# behaviour rather than a bug. `wp plugin verify-checksums --all` reports e.g.
# "Verified 2 of 3 plugins (1 skipped)" and STILL EXITS 0 -- the skip happens
# because a plugin has no checksum published on WordPress.org, which is true of
# every commercial plugin and every bespoke one. A caller that trusts the exit
# code sees success while a plugin went unchecked.
#
# So this parses the counts, compares verified against total, and reports the
# three states separately, because they mean completely different things:
#
#   VERIFIED  the files match what WordPress.org published
#   MODIFIED  they do NOT match -- investigate, this is the finding
#   SKIPPED   no published checksum exists -- EXPECTED for Divi, Elementor Pro
#             and anything bespoke, and NOT a problem, but it does mean those
#             files are outside this control and need integrity cover elsewhere
#
# Exits nonzero only on MODIFIED. Skipped items are reported, never counted as
# failures, and never hidden.
# SIEM CONTRACT (Wazuh and friends)
# Every outcome is written to syslog with tag `wasp-integrity` in key=value
# form, so a rule can match on fields rather than parsing prose that will
# change. The shape is stable; treat it as an interface:
#
#   wasp_integrity result=PASS|FAIL|SKIP component=core|plugins|all reason=...
#
#   auth.crit    result=FAIL  -> alert. A modified core or plugin file.
#   auth.notice  result=SKIP  -> informational. Commercial/bespoke plugins have
#                                no published checksum; expected, but it means
#                                those files need FIM cover from the SIEM side.
#   auth.info    result=PASS  -> healthy run, useful for proving the check ran.
#
# A Wazuh decoder matching `wasp_integrity` and alerting on `result=FAIL` is
# the whole integration. Nothing here needs an agent-side script.

# ── Install a theme or plugin from a LOCAL zip ───────────────────────────────
# For commercial products -- Divi, Elementor Pro, a client's bespoke plugin --
# that are not in the WordPress.org directory and never will be.
#
# WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM `install`, AND WHY IT DOES NOT TAKE A URL
#
# `install <slug>` deliberately refuses URLs and ZIPs: its whole guarantee is
# that the code came from the official directory over TLS and nowhere else.
# Weakening that to accept an arbitrary URL would turn one auditable path into
# "download and run anything", which is the supply-chain shape this platform
# refuses everywhere else.
#
# So this takes a LOCAL FILE that the operator deliberately placed on the VM.
# The trust decision is made off-box, by a human, at scp time -- not by this
# script at runtime. It records a SHA-256 either way, so what was installed can
# be compared later against what the vendor shipped.
#
# WHY THE ZIP SHOULD NOT LIVE IN YOUR GIT REPOSITORY
#
# Tempting, and wrong for four reasons. It freezes the theme at one version
# while the vendor keeps shipping security fixes. It puts ~30 MB in git history
# forever. It does not save the licensing step, since each site still needs its
# own vendor API key to activate and receive updates. And the GPL covers the
# code, not the trademark -- redistributing a commercial product under your own
# name is a poor look for an MSP even where it is lawful. Keep the zip in your
# own asset store, scp it per install, and let the vendor's updater take over
# once the licence is activated.

#
# CORRECTION (external evaluation, and it was right): an earlier version of
# this comment called that directory "signed". IT IS NOT. WordPress.org serves
# plugin packages over HTTPS, which authenticates the SERVER, but the packages
# themselves carry no cryptographic signature that this VM verifies. The

# control is worse than not having it, because it stops anyone looking for the
