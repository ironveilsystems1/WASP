# FORENSIC FIX (new-audit High finding, confirmed accurate): "enable
# uploads-php" (i.e. open the PHP-execution block) had no automatic
# expiration — a real risk since wp-content/uploads is exactly where an
# attacker who can get a file onto the server would want PHP to execute.
# Left open and forgotten, it's a standing hole with no timer on it. This
# marker file's mtime is the timer: written when opened, checked by a cron
# entry (see payload/cron/wordpress-vm.cron) that re-blocks automatically
# after UPLOADS_PHP_MAX_OPEN_SECS, and removed by any re-block (manual or
# automatic) so the timer can't double-fire. Persistent under
# /etc/wp-install/ (not /var/run) so a reboot while open doesn't reset the
# clock — the whole point is a bound on how long this stays open.

 fail. The Apache rule stays as a second, independent layer.

 2. NPM HOST -> /data/nginx/custom/http_top.conf
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 limit_req_zone lives in the http block, which the Advanced tab cannot
 reach. Create the file if it does not exist, then restart NPM.

# Keyed on POST only. An empty key is not rate limited, so GETs — every
# CSS, JS and image the login page pulls — pass freely.
#
# The earlier version keyed on $binary_remote_addr and the location
# matched the whole admin tree. A single login page load is a dozen or
# more requests, so the budget was spent by the page loading itself and
# nginx answered 503 — its DEFAULT status for limit_req — for everything
# after. The front page kept working because it did not match.
map $request_method $wplogin_limit_key {
    POST    $binary_remote_addr;
    default "";
}
limit_req_zone $wplogin_limit_key zone=wplogin:10m rate=6r/m;

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 3. Verify, in this order
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 a) From an ALLOWED address, load the login page. It must still work.
    Locking yourself out is the likeliest way this goes wrong.

 b) From a phone on mobile data (wifi OFF):
       expect 403 from nginx — it should not reach this VM at all

 c) Back on this VM, confirm what Apache now sees:
       wp-hardening.sh proxy-check
    interpreted= should show the REAL client, never the proxy.

 d) Rate limit, from an allowed address:
       for i in $(seq 1 10); do curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code} "          https://YOUR-DOMAIN/YOUR-LOGIN-PATH; done; echo
    Expect a few 200s then 429s.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 What this does NOT fix
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 Restricting at nginx protects the admin paths. The login rate limiter,
 CrowdSec and GeoIP on the VM still identify clients from
 X-Forwarded-For, so they still depend on mod_remoteip working. Section 1
 makes that header trustworthy; it does not remove the dependency.

 The edge rate limit is the exception — it works on $remote_addr directly
 and holds even if everything downstream is misconfigured. That is why it
 is worth adding even though the VM already rate-limits logins.
