# wasp-triage.sh — is THIS already-deployed VM affected by a known defect?
# =============================================================================
#   wasp-triage.sh            check and report
#   wasp-triage.sh --fix      apply the fixes that are safe to apply in place
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Several releases in the 2026.08.12 series shipped defects that leave a VM
# running and looking healthy while a control is silently absent. On a fleet
# that is already deployed, "redeploy everything" is not a plan — it is a week
# of client downtime for problems that mostly patch in place.
#
# So this checks the SPECIFIC known-bad states, on the running system, and says
# which apply here. It reads state rather than version strings, because a VM
# may have been partly patched by hand and the version alone will not tell you.
#
# Every finding names the release it came from, what it actually means for the
# client, and whether --fix can repair it without a redeploy.
# =============================================================================

# ── Re-validate recorded production blockers ─────────────────────────────────
# A blocker is written when a fail-closed control does not pass at install. It
# is NOT re-tested afterwards, so once the condition is fixed the file keeps
# reporting it -- and `--check` keeps returning CRITICAL over something that is
# no longer true.
#
# Seen on a VM whose full validation passed 53/53 with MFA enforced and active,
# while --check still reported PRODUCTION-BLOCKER from the MFA entry written
# before the plugin was installed by hand. The deferred installer clears its own
# blocker; a manual install had no way to.
#
# A stale blocker is as damaging as a missing one. It trains an operator to read
# past the one thing designed to be unmissable.
