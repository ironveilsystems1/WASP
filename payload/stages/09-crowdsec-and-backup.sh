# unresolvable mail relay -- but shrugs at having no egress filtering at all --
# is not applying a consistent standard.
#
# Egress control is the one thing here that acts AFTER a compromise. Everything
# else raises the cost of getting in; this decides what an attacker can reach
# once they have. Optional-in-production made the strictest profile silently
# weaker than its own documentation implied.

# — the exact pipe-to-gzip pattern that #4 in the original audit closed
# inside do_db_update() during v7-9, but that hadn't been folded into this
# cron line because it wasn't inside do_db_update() itself. Same failure
# mode: cron's default shell has no pipefail, so a `mariadb-dump` failure
# was masked by gzip's own successful exit on empty input — producing a
# valid, empty, unrestorable .sql.gz that then aged into the retention
# window while older good backups were rotated out. wp-db-backup.sh
# reuses do_db_update's proven pipeline: write raw SQL first (so its own
# exit status is what's checked, not gzip's), confirm the dump completed
# by looking for mariadb-dump's own trailing marker, gzip and verify with
# gzip -t, and only THEN rotate. If any step fails, the partial file is

# 8G FIREWALL v1.4 — Apache .htaccess WAF, runs before PHP (fast)
# Sourced: perishablepress.com/8g-firewall (free for all use, credit intact)
# WordPress only rewrites between # BEGIN/END WordPress markers —
# our 8G rules placed ABOVE that block survive any WordPress .htaccess flush.
# DIVI: visual builder (admin-ajax, REST API) unaffected by these rules.
# Toggle: wp-hardening.sh disable 8g  or  wp-hardening.sh enable 8g

# TRIVY — Container vulnerability scanner (gates updates in update.sh)
# The version lives in stage 10 as TRIVY_VER and is NOT restated here. A second
# number in a second file is how this drifted: v0.72.0 in one place, v0.71.2 in
# another, and an operator reading either would believe it was the pinned one.
# Cache at /var/cache/trivy persists across reboots.
# First scan downloads the DB (~100-200 MB); subsequent scans use cache (<15s).
