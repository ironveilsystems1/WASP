# ── Custom login slug: WordPress-side support (v7-14) ───────────────────────
# BUG FIX (v7-14) — WITHOUT THIS THE SLUG LOCKS YOU OUT OF YOUR OWN SITE.
# v7-14 made the slug a real boundary by blocking direct /wp-login.php in
# .htaccess. But WordPress generates its OWN login URLs from
# site_url('wp-login.php', ...) in at least four places that all matter:
#   • the <form action> on the login page itself (scheme 'login_post')
#   • wp_login_url() used by auth_redirect() when a logged-out user hits
#     any /wp-admin/ page
#   • the "Lost your password?" and logout links
#   • the redirect after a successful login
# So without a WordPress-side fix, the sequence is: visit the slug (works,
# internal rewrite) -> page renders with action="http://host/wp-login.php"
# -> submit -> POST goes to the DEFAULT path -> Apache 403s it -> login is
# impossible. That is almost certainly the "custom slug didn't work" symptom
# from earlier versions, made fatal rather than merely cosmetic by the new
# block. This must-use plugin closes it by rewriting those generated URLs to
# the slug, so WordPress never emits (or depends on) the default path.
#
# mu-plugins is used deliberately over a normal plugin: mu-plugins load
# unconditionally, cannot be deactivated from the admin UI, and survive
# plugin-wipe recovery steps — appropriate for something that, if disabled,
# makes the site unreachable.

# ── OpenRC: mariadb-container ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# GEOIP COUNTRY FILTERING (optional — only runs if GEOIP_ENABLED=1)
#
# BUG FIX (v7-4): GeoIP silently never got applied in the field even with
# valid MaxMind credentials. Root cause: `podman build` for the mod_maxminddb
# image runs its RUN steps (apt-get, curl) in a build-time container that
# is NOT on wp-front/wp-db (10.89.10.0/24 / 10.89.20.0/24) — it's on Podman's
# default bridge subnet. But by this point in Stage 2 the nftables ruleset is
# already loaded, and its forward chain only allows those two subnets before
# its policy DROP:
#   ip saddr/daddr 10.89.10.0/24 accept
#   ip saddr/daddr 10.89.20.0/24 accept
# So the build container's outbound internet access (apt-get update, the
# mod_maxminddb download) was silently dropped by the firewall, apt-get
# failed, `podman build` failed, and — because everything past that point
# (maxminddb.load, the GeoLite2 download, geoip.conf) lives inside the
# `if podman build ...; then` success branch — nothing else ever ran. No
# error reached the console because the build's own output only went to
# the install log, and the failure path just printed one generic warning.
#
# FIX: `podman build --network host` for this one build step, so it shares
# the host's already-working internet access instead of an unlisted bridge
# subnet the firewall drops. This does not weaken the running containers'
# isolation — it only applies to the transient build container, which never
# runs application code and is discarded once the image layer is committed.
#
# DESIGN NOTE — why a custom image at all (unchanged from v7-3):
#   Compiling mod_maxminddb via `podman exec` into a RUNNING container writes
#   to that container's ephemeral writable layer and is lost on recreate.
#   Building a small custom image instead (multi-stage: one stage compiles,
#   the final stage is the pinned WordPress image plus only the compiled
#   .so) means GeoIP survives every future update/recreate with no
#   persistence hacks. The GeoLite2 database itself is fetched directly via
#   curl on the Alpine host (documented MaxMind permalink API, plain HTTPS —
#   host-level curl uses the OUTPUT chain, which is policy-accept, so it was
#   never affected by the bug above) and bind-mounted in.
#
# REUSABILITY FIX (v7-4): this logic is now written out as a standalone,
# idempotent script — /usr/local/bin/wp-geoip-setup.sh — instead of living
# only inline here. That means if GeoIP setup ever fails again (bad
# credentials, MaxMind rate limit, transient network blip), it can be fixed
# and retried on a live VM with a single command and NO reboot and NO
# re-running the whole provisioning script:
#   1. Fix /etc/wp-install/vars.sh (MAXMIND_ACCOUNT_ID / MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY
#      / GEOIP_MODE / GEOIP_WHITELIST or GEOIP_BLOCKLIST / GEOIP_ENABLED=1)
