# ── Container image digest pinning (default ON) ───────────────────────────────
# BUG FIX (v7-5): real SHA256 digest pinning, resolved dynamically instead of
# a hardcoded placeholder. A hardcoded digest goes stale the instant any of
# these images is rebuilt under the same tag — which registries do routinely
# for security patches — silently pinning every future install to a WORSE,
# older image forever with no warning.
#
# SKOPEO REWRITE (v7-6f): resolving "what digest does this tag point to right
# now" used to mean a full `podman pull` (150-200+ MB each for WordPress/
# MariaDB) just to ask Podman what it downloaded. Skopeo's `inspect
# docker://ref` asks the registry's manifest endpoint directly — a few KB, no
# layer data — so the digest is known before anything is pulled. A `podman
# pull` still happens here (the image needs to actually land locally to run
# it), but only once, against the exact `repo@sha256:digest` reference that's
# actually going to be pinned — not as a separate discovery pull first. If
# Skopeo is missing or a lookup fails, _pin_digest falls back to the
# pre-v7-6f method (pull by tag, ask Podman what it resolved) automatically
# — never fatal, just the old bandwidth cost for that one image. update.sh
# uses this same Skopeo-first approach for its own checks, where the payoff
# is bigger: a routine `update.sh check` no longer pulls anything at all.
#
# FORMAT NOTE (v7-6f): the old "does this Podman accept a combined
# repo:tag@sha256:digest reference" compatibility test is gone. Every pinned
# reference is now the universally-supported digest-only form
# (`repo@sha256:digest`); the tag is tracked separately in the new
# /etc/wp-install/pinned.env instead of inside the image reference itself —
# see the PERSIST block below. update.sh's `check`/`status` output is the
# place to see tag info now, not `podman ps`. wp-geoip-setup.sh's tag
# derivation was updated to match — it now reads pinned.env directly instead
# of trying to sed the tag back out of a reference that may no longer
# contain one (see that script for details).
#
# RETRY + DIAGNOSTICS (v7-5c, carried forward unchanged): both the pull and
# the digest-resolution step retry up to 3 times, and any final failure
# writes the ACTUAL error text (not just "failed") to
# /var/log/wp-digest-pinning.log for later diagnosis, plus a short pointer
# to that log in the normal warn() output. A pin-count summary is also
# printed once all three images are resolved.

  # $1 = full tag reference, e.g. docker.io/wordpress:7.1-php8.4-apache
  # stdout: sha256:<64 hex> on success. Returns 1 on any failure (Skopeo
  # missing, network error, unparseable output) — treated as "fall back",
  # never as fatal.
  #
  # BUG FIX (v7-14): this used to return a MULTI-LINE value. `skopeo
  # inspect` emits the top-level image manifest "Digest" AND a "LayersData"
  # array whose every element also carries a "Digest" field, so an
  # unbounded grep returned the manifest digest plus every layer digest.
  # _pin_digest() then built "${repo}@${digest}" out of that, producing an
  # invalid reference that `podman pull` rejected on all 3 attempts before
  # falling through to a full tag pull — so the whole point of resolving
  # via Skopeo (cheap manifest query, no pull) never actually happened.
  # See the fuller note on the matching function inside update.sh.
  # FIX: use Skopeo's --format to ask for exactly that one field, fall back
  # to jq (v7-15, audit #2) then a head-1'd grep on older Skopeo, and
  # validate single-line sha256 shape before returning.
