ts "Installing Trivy vulnerability scanner"
# Pinned to a specific release, with the release's own checksums file pinned
# by hash. This is not routine hygiene -- Trivy's distribution was compromised
# TWICE in 2026:
#   * 28 Feb 2026 — repository takeover
#   * 19 Mar 2026 — a malicious binary published as v0.69.4 for ~3 hours, and
#                   credential-stealing code injected into trivy-action and
#                   setup-trivy
#   * 22 Mar 2026 — the aquasec/trivy 0.69.5 and 0.69.6 Docker Hub images were
#                   also found to contain the attacker's C2 domain
# A version pin alone would not have helped anyone who happened to pin 0.69.4.
# Verifying the download against a hash recorded here, out of band from the
# download itself, is the control that would have.
# ONE version, defined ONCE. An external evaluation found v0.72.0 here and
# v0.71.2 named in stage 09, both behind current — two numbers in one tree, and
# an operator reading either would believe it was the pinned version. The
# duplication was the real defect; being stale was the symptom.
TRIVY_VER="v0.74.0"
# SHA-256 of trivy_0.72.0_checksums.txt from the GitHub release. The binary is
# then verified against that file, so this single hash anchors the whole
# download. Re-record it by hand when bumping TRIVY_VER; a stale value fails
# closed, which is the correct direction to fail.
# SHA-256 of trivy_0.74.0_checksums.txt, FETCHED AND HASHED rather than copied
# from a page. This anchor is the whole verification chain -- the checksums file
# is verified against it, then the binary against the checksums file -- so a
# transcription error here fails every install closed, which is the right
# direction but an expensive way to find a typo.
#
# When bumping TRIVY_VER, this MUST be regenerated:
#   curl -fsSL -o /tmp/cs.txt \
#     https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/trivy_X.Y.Z_checksums.txt
#   sha256sum /tmp/cs.txt
# The install refuses on mismatch and says so, so a forgotten bump is loud
# rather than silent -- but it does mean no Trivy until it is corrected.

# setup_trivy() further above for the full rationale (Trivy v0.69.4 supply
# chain compromise, raw.githubusercontent.com serves by content-addressed
# commit hash, etc). Keep both TRIVY_VER and TRIVY_INSTALL_COMMIT updated
# together after auditing any change to contrib/install.sh.

# ── Verified download: checksums file anchored, binary verified against it ────
# TRIVY_CHECKSUMS_SHA256 was DECLARED and never USED. The comment beside it
# claimed "the binary is then verified against that file, so this single hash
# anchors the whole download" -- and nothing referenced the variable. The
# install path was commit-pinning only, which rules out a LATER tampering of
# that ref and does nothing about a compromise of the delivery path itself.
#
# Documenting a verification that does not happen is worse than documenting its
# absence: a reader stops looking for the real control. Raised by an external
# evaluation and it was exactly right.
#
# The chain now actually closes:
#   1. fetch trivy_<ver>_checksums.txt
#   2. verify THAT file against the hash recorded above, out of band
#   3. fetch the binary tarball
#   4. verify the tarball against the now-trusted checksums file
# A poisoned mirror has to match a hash recorded in this repository, which it
# cannot without also compromising the repository -- at which point the
# attacker has easier options than a Trivy build.
