/**
 * Plugin Name: WASP — Custom Login Slug
 * Description: Rewrites every login URL WordPress generates so the login form lives at your secret slug instead of /wp-login.php. Apache blocks the default path outright, so deleting this file does not restore it — it locks everyone out. Change the slug in the Apache config first, then here.
 * Author: IronVeil Systems DevOps
 * Version: 1.0
 * Apache blocks direct requests to wp-login.php unless they arrive through
 * the slug rewrite. WordPress, left alone, would still emit wp-login.php in
 * its login form action and in every auth redirect, so submitting the login
 * form would hit the blocked path and fail. This rewrites those URLs.

 * Break the redirect_to loop.
 *
 * Since the bare slug became the login URL, the login page and the page
 * WordPress redirects unauthenticated users to are THE SAME URL. So when
 * wp-login.php decides a reauth is needed, it redirects to
 * wp_login_url($redirect_to) — where $redirect_to is the current REQUEST_URI,
 * which already contains a redirect_to. Each pass nests another copy:
 *
 *   /slug?redirect_to=…/slug?redirect_to=…/slug?redirect_to=…&reauth=1
 *
 * The URL grows exponentially until it exceeds the proxy's header buffer and
 * the request comes back as 502 Bad Gateway — which looks like a proxy fault
 * and is not one.
 *
 * With the old "<slug>-login" suffix this could not happen: the entry point
 * and the login page were different URLs, so the redirect terminated. That is
 * a consequence of removing the suffix which was not obvious at the time, and
 * is worth stating rather than quietly patching.
 *
 * The fix: a redirect_to that points back at the login page is meaningless —
 * nobody wants to be sent to the login form after logging in. Replace it with
 * the admin URL, which is what was intended.
