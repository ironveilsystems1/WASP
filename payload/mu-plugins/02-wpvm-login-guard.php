/**
 * Plugin Name: WASP — Login Guard
 * Description: Rate-limits failed logins with a progressive lockout, and removes the message that tells an attacker which usernames are real. Feeds every outcome to CrowdSec so a persistent source gets banned at the firewall rather than merely slowed down here.
 * Author: IronVeil Systems DevOps
 * Version: 1.0
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A PLUGIN
 *
 * Functionally this covers what Limit Login Attempts does, minus the
 * dashboard. The reason to have it here instead is that a plugin is a
 * separate update surface, a separate CVE surface, and can be deactivated
 * from an admin panel that an attacker who got in would immediately reach.
 * A mu-plugin cannot be deactivated from wp-admin and survives core updates.
 *
 * WHAT THIS LAYER IS AND IS NOT
 *
 * This is the APPLICATION layer, and it is the weaker of the two by design.
 * Every attempt it blocks has still paid for a full WordPress bootstrap:
 * PHP started, the database was queried, the request cost you real CPU. Under
 * a distributed attack that cost is the actual problem, not the guessing.
 *
 * The strong layer is CrowdSec, which reads what this writes and bans the
 * source at nftables -- where the packet never reaches PHP at all. That is
 * why this logs in a fixed, parseable format: the log is the interface
 * between the cheap-but-weak layer and the effective one.
 *
 * ON XML-RPC: xmlrpc.php's system.multicall lets an attacker try hundreds of
 * passwords in ONE request, which is how brute-force protection is usually
 * bypassed. This VM already blocks xmlrpc.php in Apache (see wp-security.conf
 * and `wp-hardening.sh status`), so that path is closed before PHP. If you
 * ever unblock it, note that wp_login_failed fires per credential pair, so
 * this counts multicall attempts individually rather than as one request.

 * Behind a proxy, every request arrives from the proxy and mod_remoteip

 * failure in the world to a single counter. Five failed logins from anyone
 * locks out EVERYONE. An attacker does not need to guess a password to take
 * the site down; they need to guess wrong, five times.
 *
 * It also silently defeats CrowdSec (which reads the address this file logs)
 * and GeoIP (which sees an RFC1918 address and exempts it).
 *
 * Neither failing open nor failing closed is right here: without a client
 * identity, per-client rate limiting is not possible, and locking everyone
 * out is the DoS itself. So the limiter keeps working -- some limit beats
 * none -- and the condition is logged on every occurrence so it is
 * discoverable rather than invisible. validate-wordpress.sh checks for it

 * of that network by failing five logins. Carrier-grade NAT makes that a
 * mobile visitor's normal situation, not an edge case.
 *
 * Keying on the pair means an attacker hammering "admin" cannot lock out
 * "editor" from the same address, while still stopping repeated guesses at any
 * single account.
