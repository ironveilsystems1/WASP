# ── Download + verify Alpine image ────────────────────────────────────────────
# BUG FIX (v7-5): added real integrity verification. Checked directly against
# the Alpine CDN: the cloud/ qcow2 images do NOT publish a .sha256 sidecar —
# only a .sha512 and a detached GPG .asc signature (their .iso releases do
# ship .sha256, but this is a different image type/directory). SHA-512 is a
# stronger hash than SHA-256 anyway, so this isn't a downgrade — it's simply
# what Alpine actually publishes for this file. The checksum is fetched fresh
# from the SAME directory as the image, matching the already auto-selected
# ${ALPINE_URL} exactly. Deliberately NOT hardcoded: this script's own image
# selection floats across point releases (3.24, 3.23, 3.22, 3.21, whichever
# has a build available), so a fixed hash would break on the very next Alpine
# point release. GPG verification of the .asc would add defense-in-depth
# against a compromised CDN, but requires pinning Alpine's rotating
# per-release signing key — left as a manual step rather than guessed at
# here (current fingerprint is posted at https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/
# if you want to add `gpg --verify` yourself).
