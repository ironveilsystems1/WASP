  # ── Resolver choice ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # The default used to be 1.1.1.1 + 8.8.8.8. Both are fast and reliable, and
  # both are the wrong default for this product: Cloudflare and Google are US
  # (Five Eyes) operators whose business is not DNS, and on a box built to
  # minimise what leaks, every domain this VM ever looks up is exactly the kind
  # of metadata worth not handing over by default.
  #
  # Quad9 is the default instead, and the reason is not only privacy. It
  # BLOCKS KNOWN-MALICIOUS DOMAINS using threat intelligence, which is a real
  # security layer on a WordPress host: a compromised plugin phoning home to a
  # known C2 domain fails at resolution, before Squid, before nftables. It does
  # not log client IPs, is GDPR-compliant, validates DNSSEC, and answers from
  # 200+ locations across 90 countries, so it performs acceptably wherever the
  # Proxmox host happens to be.
  #
  # Everything offered below serves PLAIN DNS on port 53, because that is what
  # /etc/resolv.conf needs. This rules out several otherwise-excellent
  # providers, and the exclusion is not a judgement on them:
  #
  #   * Mullvad          DoH/DoT ONLY. Its own documentation is explicit that
  #                      the IPs "can only be used with DNS resolvers that
  #                      support DoH or DoT, not with DNS over UDP/53 or
  #                      TCP/53". Offering it here would have produced a VM
  #                      with no working DNS at all.
  #   * Applied Privacy  DoH/DoT only.
  #   * Wikimedia DNS    DoH/DoT only.
  #
  # If this VM ever grows a local DoH/DoT stub resolver, they become viable and
  # should be revisited. Until then, do not add them back.

# BUG FIX (v7-15, audit #13): validate every CIDR/IP before it's accepted.
# These values are inserted verbatim into root-owned security config —
# nftables rules (`ip saddr ${SSH_CIDR} ...`) and Apache directives
# (`Require ip ${ADMIN_CIDR}`, `RemoteIPTrustedProxy ${PROXY_IP}`). A
# malformed value doesn't just get ignored: it makes nftables fail to load
# (potentially leaving the firewall down) or Apache fail to start
# (potentially leaving the site down), and a stray token could weaken the
# very restriction it's meant to express. Validated here at input time so a
# typo is caught immediately, with a re-prompt, instead of surfacing as a
# baffling service failure 10 minutes into a background install.

# ── WordPress site identity (NEW) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# Why this is asked at install time rather than left to the browser wizard:
# WordPress stores its canonical URL in the DATABASE (wp_options.siteurl and
# .home) the moment you first complete setup. If that first visit is to the
# VM's raw IP, the IP becomes the site's identity -- baked into permalinks,
# emails, password-reset links, and (worst) into serialized PHP arrays in
# plugin/theme options, where a naive SQL find-and-replace corrupts the data
# because it doesn't fix the embedded string lengths. Moving to the real
# domain afterwards then needs wp-cli search-replace or a migration plugin.
#
# Setting WP_HOME/WP_SITEURL as constants avoids the whole problem: constants
# take precedence over the database values, so the site is born knowing its
# own name and the DB copy never matters. It also makes the URL a
# config-file change (one restart) rather than a database migration if the
# domain ever moves.

# BUG FIX (v7-13, ChatGPT Findings 8+9 in the audit): DEPLOYMENT_PROFILE
# controls how this script behaves when its OWN security verifications
# can't complete. Older versions had two separate, independently
# fail-open code paths: _verify_alpine_sha512() would msg_warn and
# return success if the .sha512 sidecar was missing/malformed or if
# sha512sum itself wasn't installed on the Proxmox host, and _pin_digest()
# would silently fall back to a tag-only reference every time its Skopeo
# lookup or its podman pull failed — so an install could complete claiming
# "digest pinning enabled" while running as few as 0/3 pinned images.
# Both are correct defaults for a homelab (an admin diagnosing a bad
# Alpine mirror doesn't want the script to abort mid-provision), but they
# leave an MSP client with no way to INSIST on those verifications
# succeeding — no toggle that turns "warn and continue" into "abort".
# DEPLOYMENT_PROFILE is that toggle:
#   • standard (default) — keeps the v7-12 behavior EXACTLY. Verifications
#     are attempted; a failure is loudly warned but not fatal. Chosen so
#     existing installs and repeat runs behave identically to before, and
#     so admins in a bad-network situation can still get a working VM.
#   • production          — the audit-graded behavior. If sha512sum isn't
#     installed on the Proxmox host, if the Alpine .sha512 sidecar can't
#     be fetched or is malformed, if fewer than 3/3 container images
#     resolve to a real @sha256: digest — any one of these aborts the
#     install instead of silently continuing. Chosen when an operator
#     needs to be able to promise a compliance auditor that the base OS
#     image and all container images actually WERE verified against
#     upstream, not merely attempted.
# Not enabled by default because the loud warnings in "standard" already
# make a failure visible to any operator who's watching the install
# output; production mode is opt-in for the operators who need to
# GUARANTEE that visibility rather than depend on it.
echo ""
# ── There is one profile: production ─────────────────────────────────────────
# The "standard" profile is gone. It existed so a verification failure -- an
# Alpine SHA-512 mismatch, a registry blip during digest pinning, a Squid that
# would not start -- could warn and continue on a lab box.
#
# In practice it did something worse than that. Every fail-closed control in
# this platform had TWO behaviours, and every external evaluation of it
# reported the same class of finding: "X fails open under standard". Each one
# was accurate. The strictest profile was the only one that meant what the
# documentation said, and the other one was a foot-gun -- a client VM built on
# the wrong answer to a prompt would look identical and guarantee nothing.
#
# One profile means one set of guarantees, one code path to reason about, and
# one set of behaviours to test. The negative-test suite covers half as many
# cases and proves twice as much.
