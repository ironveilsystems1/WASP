# WASP — MSP Operational Runbook

**Prove offsite recovery, not just offsite presence.** Verifying the remote
object exists is not proof it restores — it can be truncated or encrypted to a
key you no longer hold. Run the full round-trip monthly, and after any change
to the backup key, destination, or encryption recipient:

```sh
wasp-offsite-backup.sh remote-restore-drill
```

It pulls the actual remote object, decrypts it with the recovery key, restores
it into a throwaway database, verifies it is non-empty, and records the RTO —
turning the recovery-time number from an assumption into evidence.

RTO/RPO, onboarding, decommissioning); that one is the
> hands-on-keyboard layer.


For running WASP deployments as a service for clients. Companion to
[INCIDENT-PLAYBOOK.md](INCIDENT-PLAYBOOK.md), which covers what to do when
something fires; this covers the commitments around it.

**These are templates with defaults, not promises made on your behalf.** Every
number below should be argued about with the client before it appears in a
contract. A target you cannot meet on a bad day is worse than a longer one you
can always meet.

---

## Recovery objectives

**RPO** — how much data you can afford to lose.
**RTO** — how long until service is back.

| | Default | Determined by | To improve it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RPO** | **24 hours** | Backup runs nightly at 02:00 UTC | Add a midday run; WordPress has no incremental DB backup |
| **RTO — bad update** | **~5 minutes** | `update.sh` auto-rollback, or a Proxmox snapshot | Snapshot before every change |
| **RTO — VM lost** | **2–4 hours** | Reinstall, then restore the newest off-VM backup | Keep a warm standby, or a recent full VM backup |
| **RTO — compromise** | **4–24 hours** | Investigation time, not restore time | Nothing shortens this safely; see below |

**Compromise RTO is deliberately vague, and should stay that way in a contract.**
Restoring takes minutes. Establishing *when* the compromise started — which
decides which backup is clean — takes as long as it takes. Restoring a backup
that already contains the backdoor is the common and expensive mistake, and a
tight RTO is what pressures someone into it.

Verify the objectives rather than assuming them:

```sh
wasp-selftest.sh restore-test        # proves the backup restores
wasp-offsite-backup.sh verify        # proves a copy exists off the VM
```

An RPO backed by a backup nobody has restored is a number, not a commitment.

## Service levels

Response time is when a human starts; resolution depends on what it turns out to be.

| Severity | Example | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S1** | Site down, or active compromise | 1 hour | Compromise may mean deliberately staying down |
| **S2** | Admin inaccessible, backups failing, off-VM copy missing | 4 hours | Failing backups are S2 even though nothing is visibly broken |
| **S3** | Vulnerable plugin with a fix available, cert expiring | 1 business day | |
| **S4** | Advisory, hardening suggestion, expiring exception | Next window | |

**Backup failure is S2, not S3.** Nothing looks wrong to the client, and each
day it continues raises the cost of the incident that eventually needs it.

**Fleet monitoring is three layers, covered in `docs/FLEET.md`:** Pulse for VM liveness, `validate-wordpress.sh --check` per VM for WASP health, optionally MainWP for WordPress maintenance (protect its dashboard hardest — it holds keys to every site).

### What monitoring covers

| Alert | Tag | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Backup failed | `wp-db-backup` | S2 |
| `validate-wordpress.sh --check` returns 2 | poll from your monitoring | S1 |
| `validate-wordpress.sh --check` returns 1 | poll from your monitoring | S2 |
| Off-VM copy failed | `wasp-offsite` | S2 |
| CRITICAL malware finding | `wp-malware` | S1 |
| Vulnerability finding | `wp-vulns` | S3 |
| Self-test failed | `wasp-selftest` | S2 |
| Exception expiring | `wasp-vuln-exception` | S4 |

**Uptime is covered by the heartbeat, and only by that.** Every other check
runs *on* the VM, so a VM that is off, unreachable, or on a dead hypervisor
reports nothing — and silence looks identical to health.

```sh
wp-notify.sh --heartbeat-url https://hc-ping.com/<uuid>
```

It verifies WordPress serves and MariaDB answers before pinging, so a
heartbeat cannot report healthy through a broken site. Set the external
check's period to 15 minutes with a 30-minute grace.

## Change control

| Change | Approval | Before | After |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plugin/theme update | Operator | Snapshot | `validate-wordpress.sh` |
| WordPress core / PHP | Operator, client informed | Snapshot | Candidate cutover handles rollback |
| Host `apk upgrade` | Operator | Snapshot | Reboot in a window |
| Firewall or admin CIDR | Operator + a second pair of eyes | **Console access confirmed** | `wp-hardening.sh proxy-check` |
| Accepting a vulnerability | Operator; governance accountable | Written justification | Emailed automatically |
| Restoring from backup | Client decides | Backup of current state | `wasp-selftest.sh` |
| Proving offsite recovery works | Operator, monthly | — | `wasp-offsite-backup.sh remote-restore-drill` |
| Egress allowlist change | Operator | Note why the destination is required | `wasp-egress test` |
| Importing a client site | Client confirms the source | `wp-import.sh inspect` and `scan` | `wp-malware-scan.sh full` on the live site |

**Confirm console access before any firewall change.** `qm terminal <VMID>`
works when SSH and HTTP do not, and the failure mode of an access-control
change is losing the ability to undo it. This has already happened once in
this project's history.

### Standard change

```sh
qm snapshot <VMID> pre-change-$(date +%Y%m%d)     # Proxmox host
doas update.sh versions
doas update.sh wp <tag>                            # candidate → scan → cutover
doas validate-wordpress.sh
doas wasp-testreport.sh
```

Rollback: `qm rollback <VMID> pre-change-YYYYMMDD`, or let `update.sh` do it —
it reverts automatically when the post-cutover health check fails.

---

## Vulnerability exceptions

Accepting a HIGH or CRITICAL finding to allow an update is sometimes right —
the fix may not exist. What must not happen is that it becomes invisible.

```sh
wp-hardening.sh exceptions          # active, expiring, expired
wp-hardening.sh exceptions-check    # the weekly reminder
```

Each exception records the **image digest** (so it cannot silently cover a
later image), the **CVEs accepted**, **who** accepted it, and an **expiry**
(90 days default). It emails the governance address with the CVE list.

**This is not an approval workflow, deliberately.** Approval belongs in
whatever process you already run. The system enforces the record; it cannot
enforce that a conversation happened — which is exactly why the notice goes to
an address other than the person who accepted it.

Review monthly. An exception nobody re-argues should lapse rather than quietly
become policy.

## Onboarding a client site

```sh
wp-import.sh where                    # how to get the backup here
wp-import.sh inspect <file>           # reads the index, extracts nothing
wp-import.sh extract <file>
wp-import.sh scan
wp-import.sh apply
```

**Inspect and scan before quoting the work.** A backup with a webshell in
uploads and code in autoloaded options is a cleanup engagement, not a
migration, and finding that out afterwards is how a fixed-price migration
becomes an unpaid incident response.

The gate refuses on CRITICAL without `--force`, and every override is
recorded with who made it — useful when the client later asks what was known
at the time.

**After any import**, treat the plugin set as unknown: it is someone else's.

```sh
wp-plugins.sh vulns
wp-malware-scan.sh full
wp-forensics.sh admins                # accounts you did not create
```

**Commission the VM before handing it over.** One guided pass runs the whole
read-only validation suite and tells you everything that is wrong in one go:

```sh
wasp-menu        # → 7) Testing & validation → 1) Commission check
```

It does not stop at the first failure, and when everything passes it explicitly
does *not* call the VM proven — it names the two things still owed: the offsite
restore drill, and (if MFA is enforced) a deliberate admin lockout to confirm
console recovery works. Those are the two failures that actually cost a client
their site.

**If the client uses a commercial theme**, install it from a file rather than
lowering the hardening, and allow its licence domain so it keeps updating:

```sh
scp divi.zip admin@vm:/var/lib/wasp-import/incoming/
doas wp-plugins.sh install-file /var/lib/wasp-import/incoming/divi.zip --activate
doas wasp-egress.sh allow .elegantthemes.com
```

Then enter the vendor API key in wp-admin. Without it the theme is frozen at
the version you installed — which for a page builder means no security fixes,
and that is the client's problem to be told about, not one to discover later.

**Enable admin MFA as part of onboarding.** If the VM was provisioned with MFA
enforcement, confirm the Two Factor plugin is active and walk the client's
administrators through enrolling — an authenticator app plus **printed backup
codes**. If it was not provisioned with enforcement and the client wants it:

```sh
wp-plugins.sh install two-factor --activate
# then set MFA_ENFORCE=1 in /etc/wp-install/vars.sh and re-run provisioning,
# or leave it opt-in and just have admins enrol from their profile.
```

The backup codes are the difference between a lost phone being a five-minute
console reset and a support escalation. Make the client save them somewhere
that is not the site.

## Weekly review

[docs/WEEKLY-CHECKLIST.md](docs/WEEKLY-CHECKLIST.md) — print one per client per
week. It ships with the repository so it versions alongside the code: if a
command on it does not exist on the VM you are auditing, that VM predates the
tooling and is worth upgrading before the review.

It opens with the commission check, which covers ten of its items in one pass.
The rest is what the commission check cannot judge: currency against upstream,
client-specific policy, and evidence you have to go and gather.

## Triaging an already-deployed fleet

Several releases in the 2026.08.12 series shipped defects that leave a VM
running and looking healthy while a control is silently absent — no firewall,
no outbound mail, no alerting. "Redeploy everything" is not a plan for a fleet
already in production; most of these patch in place.

Run this on each VM before deciding anything:

```sh
doas wasp-triage.sh
```

`wasp-triage.sh` reads the RUNNING state rather than the version string,
because a VM may have been partly patched by hand and the version alone will
not tell you. It reports each known-bad condition, what it means for that
client, and whether it can be repaired without a redeploy. Exit code 2 means
live exposure, 1 means something promised is not working, 0 means clear.

Work the fleet in this order, worst first:

1. **No firewall** — the VM is exposed exactly as if none of the hardening were
   configured. Nothing else matters until this is fixed.
2. **No outbound mail** — password resets and every alert fail silently.
3. **Notifier crashing** — backup failures and the heartbeat cannot report, and
   silence is indistinguishable from healthy.
4. **WordPress below 7.0.4** — a pre-auth login XSS and an Author+ RCE.
5. The rest.

Record the triage output per client in the ticket. On a fleet, "I think I fixed
that one" is not a record.

## Recovery time, and what you can tell a client

`wasp-offsite-backup.sh remote-restore-drill` prints a measured RTO. On the
reference deployment that is **33 seconds** for a 977 KB archive — 2s to fetch,
19s to decrypt and verify, 12s to restore.

Use the drill's own number rather than that one. It scales with database size
and link speed, and a client's RPO/RTO conversation should be grounded in their
VM, not a reference figure.

What the drill proves, precisely: that the object in off-site storage can be
retrieved, decrypted with the key you hold, and loaded into a working database.
What it does not prove is that the site comes back — that is a restore into
production, which is a different and more disruptive exercise.

Run it monthly, and after any change to the backup key, the destination, or the
encryption recipient. Record the RTO in the ticket each time; a number that
drifts upward is the early warning that a database has outgrown its recovery
window.

## Key custody

Fill in [docs/KEY-CUSTODY.md](docs/KEY-CUSTODY.md) per client and store it
somewhere that survives you being unavailable.

One item on it is not like the others. Losing the object-storage credentials
means you cannot *reach* the backups — a support ticket. Losing the **age key**
means you cannot *read* them, and there is no remedy at all. It is deliberately
not kept on the VM, so it exists only where you put it.

`wasp-offsite-backup.sh remote-restore-drill` is what proves you still have a
working copy. A key you have never tested is a key you do not have.

## Decommissioning

Order matters — the last step destroys the evidence for the others.

```sh
# 1. Final backup, verified, off-VM
doas wp-db-backup.sh
doas wasp-offsite-backup.sh verify

# 2. Prove it restores BEFORE anything is destroyed
doas wasp-selftest.sh restore-test

# 3. Export what the client is owed
doas wp-forensics.sh admins                    # account list
doas wp-hardening.sh exceptions                # accepted risks
doas cp /var/log/wasp-vuln-exceptions.log /root/handover/

# 4. Stop, do not delete
doas rc-service wp-container stop
# Proxmox host:
qm snapshot <VMID> decommission-$(date +%Y%m%d)
qm stop <VMID>
```

**Then wait.** Keep the stopped VM for your agreed retention — 30 days is
common — before `qm destroy`. Requests for "one more thing from the old site"
arrive after shutdown, not before.

### Credentials to revoke

Not on the VM, so nothing on it will remind you:

**Rotation is now tooled**, so "rotate every credential" in the incident
process is a command rather than an afternoon of hand-editing:

```sh
wp-rotate-secrets.sh all              # database + salts, verified and reversible
wp-rotate-secrets.sh smtp '<new>'     # after changing it at the relay
```

The age backup key is deliberately excluded — rotating it makes every existing
encrypted backup unreadable. Treat that as a re-encryption project, not a
rotation.

### Credentials to revoke on decommission

- SSH key on the backup host (`authorized_keys`)
- S3/R2 API token
- MaxMind licence key
- Wordfence token
- CrowdSec console enrolment
- SMTP relay account
- DNS records pointing at the proxy

### Backup encryption key

If backups were encrypted, **keep the age private key for as long as you keep
the backups** — they are unreadable without it. If you are destroying the
backups, destroy the key with them and record that you did. A key retained
after the data is gone is a liability with no corresponding benefit.

---

## Client-facing summary

What you can honestly claim, and what you cannot:

**Can:** egress restricted to approved destinations, with the firewall — not
application settings — enforcing it. Nightly backups, verified and copied off the VM, with restores proven
weekly by an automated test. Daily vulnerability scanning against known-issue
databases. Daily malware and integrity scanning. Firewall, geographic and
behavioural blocking. Updates tested on a throwaway container before
production, with automatic rollback. Every accepted risk recorded, expiring
and reported.

**Cannot:** guarantee no compromise. Nothing detects a backdoor written
specifically for this site, and roughly 46% of WordPress plugin
vulnerabilities have no patch when disclosed. What this buys is that a
compromise is more likely to be *detected*, that recovery is *proven* rather
than hoped for, and that the decisions taken along the way are *written down*.

Say the second part out loud. A client who believes they bought immunity is a
client who will be angry about the wrong thing.
