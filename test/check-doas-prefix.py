"""
check-doas-prefix.py — a suggested command must work when pasted.

WHY THIS EXISTS

Reported from a live install. The tool printed a diagnostic to run:

    nft list ruleset | grep -A6 'wp-front egress'

The operator pasted it and got:

    Operation not permitted (you must be root)

Root SSH is disabled on this platform by design, so an admin is never root and
every root-requiring command needs `doas`. A suggestion that fails on paste is
a small betrayal of trust in every other suggestion the tool makes — and it
happens at the worst moment, when someone is following instructions because
something has already gone wrong.

The compound case is worse than the simple one:

    doas podman rename wordpress-old wordpress && podman start wordpress

That half-works. The rename succeeds, the start fails, and the operator is left
in a state neither they nor the message anticipated. So every segment of a
chain is checked, not just the first.

WHAT IT CHECKS

Lines that PRINT a command for the operator (echo/printf/warn/_note), where the
command is one of the known root-requiring binaries and is not preceded by
`doas`. Commands that merely appear inside executing code are ignored — those
already run as root.
