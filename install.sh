# install.sh — WordPress VM provisioning entry point (Proxmox VE host)
# =============================================================================
# Run this ON THE PROXMOX HOST as root. It builds a hardened Alpine +
# Podman (WordPress + MariaDB) + CrowdSec VM: downloads and verifies the
# Alpine cloud image, injects configuration and the in-VM installer directly
# onto the disk image (no network dependency inside the VM for the initial
# file layout), then creates and starts the Proxmox VM.
#
# This used to be one 8,694-line script. It is now this thin entry point
# plus lib/*.sh (sourced below, in order) and payload/ (files copied onto
# the VM disk for the in-VM installer to use). See README.md for the full
# repository layout and CHANGELOG.md for what changed and why.
#
# USAGE — two supported ways to run this, both fully supported, not one
# "real" way and one fallback:
#
#   1. Single command, no git required (Proxmox does not ship git by
#      default, and this avoids installing it just to fetch a script):
#        curl -fsSL -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ironveilsystems1/WASP/refs/heads/main/install.sh
#        chmod +x install.sh
#        sudo ./install.sh
#      install.sh notices it's running standalone (no sibling lib/ or
#      payload/) and fetches the rest of the repository itself -- see
#      "Self-bootstrap" below for exactly what that does and why.
#
#   2. A full clone, if you already have git or want the whole history:
#        git clone https://github.com/ironveilsystems1/WASP.git
#        cd WASP
#        sudo ./install.sh
#      install.sh finds lib/ and payload/ right next to itself and skips
#      the self-bootstrap step entirely -- nothing is downloaded twice.
#
# Every prompt, default, generated file, and VM setting is unchanged from
# v8-1 -- this is a reorganization, not a rewrite. See CHANGELOG.md.
# =============================================================================

# ── Self-bootstrap ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Added for the curl-one-liner usage above. install.sh on its own is not
# enough to build the VM -- lib/*.sh has to run somewhere, and payload/ has
# to physically exist somewhere to be copied onto the VM disk. When a full
# checkout isn't there already, this fetches ONLY what's missing: the
# GitHub-generated tarball of the whole repo (no git needed -- it's a plain
# HTTPS download GitHub builds on request), into a temp directory that is
# deleted again when this script exits, by the SAME cleanup() trap that
# already tears down every other temp resource this install creates (see
# lib/00-preflight.sh) -- "minimize what's loaded onto the Proxmox host"
# means during the ~15-minute run, not permanently, and this doesn't touch
# a real git clone (REPO_DIR then points at YOUR directory, never deleted).
#
# Verifying what you run: this downloads over HTTPS (TLS already rules out
# tampering in transit) from whatever WPVM_REPO_REF names -- "main" by
# default, i.e. whatever is on the branch right now. That is the right
# default for "always get the latest fixes" but it is a materially weaker
# integrity story than pinning to a specific commit: a floating branch
# means a future compromise of the repo is fetched by every install run
# from that point on, with nothing here to catch it. If you want a fixed,
# reviewable reference instead of "whatever main is today," set
# WPVM_REPO_REF to a specific commit SHA (from this repo's own commit
# history) before running:
#   WPVM_REPO_REF=<40-char-sha> sudo -E ./install.sh
# This is the same trade-off, and the same trust model, as any single-file
# "curl | bash" installer (Docker's, rustup's, Homebrew's) -- no download-
# time checksum can substitute for that, since a checksum published in the
# same repo it's meant to verify is checking the repo against itself, not
# against an independent source. What a checksum-of-this-download CAN
# catch -- truncation, a corrupted transfer, a wrong URL -- it does; see
# the size and structure checks below.

# old owner/name indefinitely, so existing clones keep working — but a new
# install should fetch from the current path rather than rely on a redirect
# that is a courtesy, not a guarantee.

# ── Release signature verification ────────────────────────────────────────────
# The public key is embedded here rather than fetched, because a key fetched
# alongside the thing it verifies proves nothing. Publish this fingerprint
# somewhere that is NOT this repository -- a project site, a release
# announcement -- so it can be checked against an independent source once.
# After that, a repository compromise cannot go unnoticed: the attacker would
# have to change this line too, and anyone who recorded the key sees it.
#
# Honest scope: for a first-time user who fetches install.sh and the release
# from the same place, this is not a root of trust. It is tamper-evidence
# with a short, checkable identifier -- which is meaningfully better than an
# unsigned curl|bash, and is not the same as a trusted supply chain.
# ── Build identity ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Written to /etc/wp-install/vars.sh at install and shown by the banner, the
# validator and the test report.
#
# This exists because of a real, expensive confusion: a VM installed from an
# earlier build served its login page at "/<slug>-login", a later build moved
# it to the bare "/<slug>", and several hours were spent diagnosing an
# imagined fault in mod_remoteip, nftables and nginx before anyone established
# which of the two was actually running. Logs and diagnostics that do not
# state their build cannot be reasoned about safely.
#
# Bump this whenever behaviour changes in a way an operator would notice.
# Two identifiers, deliberately. WASP_RELEASE is what a human quotes -- "we're
# on 9.3" -- and what a client sees on a change ticket. WASP_VERSION is the
# build stamp: date plus a letter, unique per build, which is what every log
# line, every PRODUCTION-BLOCKER and every CHANGELOG entry references. A single
# semver would lose the ability to say WHICH 9.3 a VM is running, and this
# project has already spent a session on exactly that ambiguity.
